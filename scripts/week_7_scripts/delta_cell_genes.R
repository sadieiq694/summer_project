# Delta Cell Genes

# Mark Keller provided me with a gene module that was generated based on the correlation
# structures of all the genes in the genome. This particular module includes many genes known 
# to be expressed almost exclusively in delta cells. He brought the module to my attention
# because he noticed two genes that I have been looking at, Ptprz1 and Ghsr, were included in 
# it. Upon closer inspection, almost every gene I have come across in my analysis can be found
# in the module. When Mark and Petr generated a QTL plot for the eigentrait of this module, 
# they found peaks on chromosomes 4, 6, and 18, the three peaks I have been focusing on 
# recently in my research. It is also important to note that all of the traits on the list 
# that I have analyzed thus far are negatively correlated with food intake and body weight
# phenotypes. The existence and nature of this module has several implications in my research.
# First of all, it suggests that the composition of pancreatic islets is a heritable trait
# (in the future I will run heritability estimates on the delta cell eigengene to confirm this). 
# It also broadens my hypothesis; now I am not just looking for a link between Ghsr expression 
# in the islet and food intake, I am interested in the relationship between the number of delta
# cells in the islet and food intake. 
# Here I will do more research on the genes in the module to confirm my correlation hypothesis.
